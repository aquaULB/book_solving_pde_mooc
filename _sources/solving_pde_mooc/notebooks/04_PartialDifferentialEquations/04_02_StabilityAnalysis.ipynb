    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we have introduced two methods to analyse the stability of the discretization of partial differential equations: matrix stability analysis and modified wavenumber stability analysis. The first one highlights the role of the discretization matrix in the amplification of the solution through the process of power iteration. It is quite general but its application using pen and paper is limited to certain classes of matrices. The modified wavenumber stability analysis is in principal restricted to problems in periodic domains but it is easier to carry out in many cases. In the next notebooks of this chapter, we will consider the heat equation in 1D and 2D, and further discuss how the concepts developed here apply in that context."
