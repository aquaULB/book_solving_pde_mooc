    "In this part of the course we describe how to compute numerically derivatives of functions such as,\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: eq:testfunc\n",
    "f(x)=e^x \\sin(3\\pi x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several conceptually different ways to do this. Following the same approach as for time integration, we can rely on Taylor's theorem to use the value of $f(x)$ at some neighboring points of $x$. This approach relies on what are known as finite differences. Another way to compute derivatives relies on decomposing the function $f(x)$ on a basis of functions $T_k(x)$ and computing the derivatives of $f(x)$ from the known derivatives of $T_k(x)$. This method is known as the spectral method and will be described later on in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $x$ be the continuous variable defined in the interval $x\\in[x_0,x_n]$. In any numerical problem, we have to limit the number of points at which we store the values of $f(x)$ because the random access memory (RAM) of our computers is limited. We therefore need to introduce an approximation of our continuous interval - the numerical grid. It is a set of grid points at which we evaluate all physical quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity consider a uniform grid in which the $n+1$ grid points are evenly distributed. Therefore the coordinates of the grid points are:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    " x_i = i \\Delta x, \\; \\; 0\\leq i \\leq n\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "with the endpoints of the grid located respectively at $x_0$ and $x_n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will refer to the continuous variable defined in $[x_0,x_n]$ by $x$, and to its discrete representation by $x_i$. $x_i$ is called a *grid point* or sometimes a *grid node*. The value of some function $f(x)$ at the grid point $x_i$ is then denoted as $f_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these notations, the approximation of a derivative through a finite-difference expression is generically given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: eq:diffgeneric\n",
    "f^{(k)}_i = \\frac{1}{(\\Delta x)^k}\\sum_{j\\in\\mathcal{J}}c_j f_{i+j},\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where $k$ represents the order of derivative, $\\mathcal{J}$ is called the *stencil* - the group of points used to build the finite-difference approximation - and $c_j$ is the finite-difference coefficient defined at the stencil point of index $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## First-order derivative\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of how the finite-difference approximation for a derivative of a given order can be derived, let us consider the first-order derivative of $f(x)$. According to Taylor's theorem, we can approximate $f(x+\\Delta x)$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: TaylorSer\n",
    "f(x+\\Delta x)= f(x)+f'(x)\\Delta x+O(\\Delta x^2).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Expression {eq}`TaylorSer` is exact and allows us to get the following expression for the first-order derivative of $f$ at point $x$:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: eq:forwardTaylorDiff1\n",
    "f'(x) = \\frac{f(x+\\Delta x) - f(x)}{\\Delta x}+O(\\Delta x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This expression is the usual left derivative of $f(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To approximate {eq}`eq:forwardTaylorDiff1` on the grid $x_0, x_1,\\dots, x_i,\\dots x_{n-1}, x_n$, we define the following first-order accurate approximation of $f'$ at $x_i$:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: eq:forwardNodal\n",
    "f^{' \\rm f}_i = \\frac{f_{i+1} - f_i}{\\Delta x},\\;\\; \\hbox{forward finite difference}.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The stencil for this expression is given by the sequence `[0, 1]`, where `0` stands for the point at which the derivative is evaluated, and the corresponding finite-difference coefficients are `[-1, 1]` (see {eq}`eq:diffgeneric`).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following figure we illustrate the stencil and mark in red the points involved in the computation:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"600px\" src=\"../figures/forwardDiff1.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Above the stencil, we display the quantity computed, and below the stencil we display the quantities involved in its computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to highlight that the *enumeration of a stencil has nothing to do with the enumeration of the grid points*. The enumeration of grid points usually starts at one of the grid boundaries ($x_0$ in our cases) and ends at another boundary. The enumeration of a stencil is characteristic of each particular approximation. The stencil point labeled $0$ corresponds to the grid point at which the derivative is being approximated. The stencil indices then decrease to the left of this point and increase to its right. This is why in the above example the stencil is `[0, 1]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above stencil, we use two grid points - $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$ - to obtain a first-order accurate expression for the first-order derivative at $x_i$. It is obvious that the forward finite difference formula {eq}`eq:forwardNodal` cannot be used at the right boundary node $x_n$. In section [One-sided finite differences](#One-sided-finite-differences), we discuss how the boundary nodes can be handled when the derivatives are being evaluated using finite differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now define the backward finite-differences scheme in an identical manner. As Taylor's theorem is valid for $x$ in the interval $a < x-\\Delta x \\le x \\le x+\\Delta x < b$, we can approximate $f(x-\\Delta x)$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "f(x-\\Delta x) \\approx f(x) - f'(x)\\Delta x. \n",

    "<img width=\"600px\" src=\"../figures/backwardDiff1.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "As the forward finite-difference approximation cannot be used at the right boundary node $x_n$, the backward finite-difference approximation cannot be used at the left boundary node $x_0$. We also note that $f^{'\\rm b}_{i+1} = f^{'\\rm f}_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now derive a higher-order accurate approximation for $f'(x)$. Resorting again to Taylor's theorem we write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "& f(x+\\Delta x) \\approx f(x)+f'(x)\\Delta x+\\frac12 f''(x)\\Delta x^2 \\\\\n",

    "In the above cell, we have used the slicing of numpy arrays to extract the relevant entries from our arrays. For example, for the forward finite difference, the expression is not defined at the last grid point. Therefore, the relevant grid coordinates are not the complete `x_c` array but the *slice* `x_c[0:nx-1]`. For the centered finite differences we must exclude the first and last grid points. The appropriate coordinate array slice is then `x_c[1:nx-1]`. The notions of slicing of Python sequences are described in much more detail in the next section."

    "Now that we are fully equipped in terms of knowledge about Python indexing, let's proceed to the Python slicing. Python slicing provides simple access to subsequences in Python sequences and spares programmers the necessity to loop explicitly, as we would do in C++, for example. Moreover, Python slicing [is implemented in C and precompiled][30], so, it's considerably faster than the corresponding code implemented with a Python loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for Python slicing is the following `sequence[i:j:k]`. `i` and `j` are respectively the start and the stop indices, while `k` is the step. Therefore, the slice is built from the sequence elements with indices: $i, i+k, i+2k, \\dots, i+nk < j$. **Always remember that `sequence[i]` is included in the slice while `sequence[j]` is not.**\n",

    "## One-sided finite differences\n",
    "\n",
    "In section [First-order derivative](#First-order-derivative) we mentioned that the finite difference expressions provided cannot be applied at all grid points. The centered finite difference formula is not valid at both endpoints of the domain as it requires at those locations extra points not included in the domain. At the left boundary - $x_0$ - we could compute the first order derivative using the forward finite difference formula and at the right boundary - $x_n$ - we could use the backward finite difference formula. Throughout the domain we would then have:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "    \\begin{cases}\n",
    "\t& \\displaystyle f'(x_0) = \\frac{f(x_{1}) - f(x_0)}{\\Delta x}, \\\\\n",
    "    & \\displaystyle f'(x_i) = \\frac{f(x_{i+1}) - f(x_{i-1})}{2\\Delta x},\\; \\; 1 \\leq i \\leq n-1 \\\\\n",
    "\t& \\displaystyle f'(x_n) = \\frac{f(x_{n}) - f(x_{n-1})}{\\Delta x}.\n",
    "    \\end{cases}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The inconvenience of this formulation is that it is second-order accurate for interior grid points but only first-order accurate at boundary nodes. It might not seem a big issue, but for certain problems the overall accuracy of the solution will be first order throughout the domain and not second order as we might have wished. We will give an example of this behavior later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve our discretized operator, we have to find second-order accurate expressions for the boundary nodes and we can use Taylor's theorem to achieve this goal. At the left boundary node we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "f(x_0 + \\Delta x) = f(x_0) +f'(x_0)\\Delta x+\\frac12 f''(x_0)\\Delta x^2+O(\\Delta x^3)\\\\\n",
    "f(x_0 + 2\\Delta x) = f(x_0) +2f'(x_0)\\Delta x+4\\frac12 f''(x_0)\\Delta x^2+O(\\Delta x^3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we multiply the first equation by two and then substract the second one, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "4 f(x_0 + \\Delta x) - f(x_0 + 2\\Delta x) = 3 f(x_0) + 2f'(x_0)\\Delta x + O(\\Delta x^3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then define the following second-order accurate approximation of $f'$ at $x_0$:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "f'_0 = \\frac{-\\frac32 f_0 + 2f_1 - \\frac12 f_2}{\\Delta x}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The stencil for this expression is represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"600px\" src=\"../figures/onesideDiff1.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the following expression constitutes a second-order accurate approximation of $f'$ at $x_n$,\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "f'(x_n) = \\frac{\\frac32 f_n - 2f_{n-1} + \\frac12 f_{n-2}}{\\Delta x}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and its stencil is:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"600px\" src=\"../figures/onesideDiff1_2.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now construct a second-order discretized operator throughout the domain by using the above two expressions at the boundary nodes. Our complete computation of the second-order accurate first-order derivative then looks like (for the sake of completeness, we repeat the whole code here):"
