    "\n",
    "In this notebook we have explained how to obtain a second-order accurate finite difference formula for the second-order derivative of a function and we have provided recipes to construct many other differential operators - many more can be found on this [Wikipedia][1] page. We also discussed the concept of Python functions to produce re-usable pieces of source code. Finally, we have shown how to explicitly construct discrete versions of differential operators in matrix form. These will be used in the following notebook to solve what are known as boundary value problems.\n",
